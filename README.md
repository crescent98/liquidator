# ðŸ’¸ Port Finance Loan Liquidator

### Prerequisites

To run the liquidator you will need:

- A Solana account with some SOL deposited to cover transaction fees
- Token accounts for each token in the reserve
- Roughly equal dollar value for each token.

### Setup

Make sure to edit the .env file to look something like this:

```
export CLUSTER_URL="https://solana-api.projectserum.com"
export KEYPAIR=~/.config/solana/id.json
export PROGRAM_ID="Port7uDYB3wk6GJAw4KT1WpTeMtSu9bTcChBHkX2LfR"
export CHECK_INTERVAL="5000.0"
```

`CHECK_INTERVAL` is the amount of milliseconds to wait between querying users' loans

### Run with yarn

```
yarn install
source .env
yarn liquidator
```

### Run with Docker

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

You must put your private key file **id.json** at the root level of this folder, or update the default volume value (in `docker-compose.yaml` file) from `./id.json` to the location of your private key file.
